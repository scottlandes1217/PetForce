# Tabbed Navigation Feature

## Overview

The tabbed navigation feature allows users to open pets in tabs and pin them to keep them in the navigation until manually closed. This provides a more efficient workflow for users who need to work with multiple pets simultaneously.

## Features

### 1. Automatic Tab Creation
- When a user opens a pet page, a tab is automatically created in the navigation
- The tab shows the pet's name and includes pin/close buttons

### 2. Pin/Unpin Functionality
- Users can pin tabs to keep them in the navigation permanently
- Pinned tabs persist across browser sessions
- Users can unpin tabs to remove them from persistent storage

### 3. Tab Management
- Close individual tabs with the X button
- Close all tabs with the "Close all" button
- Switch between tabs by clicking on them
- Active tab is highlighted

### 4. Responsive Design
- Tabs adapt to different screen sizes
- Horizontal scrolling on smaller screens
- Touch-friendly on mobile devices
